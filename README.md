# AED

AED - Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados (Portuguese)

ADS - Algorithms and Data Structures

This class covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. The professors of the class were Pedro Guerreiro and António dos Anjos. Class schedule:

* Basic concepts
* Sort
* Search
* Graphs
* Sub-strings
* ...

You can see the all of the solved problems made on the class in my [GitHub](https://github.com/CyrillBrito/AED). Folder structure:

* /Libraries
   * core.jar  - Processing api to make some sketches
   * algs4.jar - Inpunt and output library
   * AED.jar   - Some java classes made in the class
* /(problem_name)
   * /doc - The problem given by the professor
   * /src - The .java files created to solve the problem

List of all the problems that me and my colleges had to solve in the class (the problems are written in Portuguese):

* Euclides, Arquimedes and Newton - A few math and logic related algorithms.
